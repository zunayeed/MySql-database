##  Order By clause: 
- [Order By Link](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-order-by/)
- When you use the SELECT statement to query data from a table, the result set is not sorted. It means that the rows in the result set can be in any order. To sort the result set, you add the ORDER BY clause to the SELECT statement. The following illustrates the syntax of the ORDER BY  clause:
```
SELECT 
   select_list
FROM 
   table_name
ORDER BY 
   column1 [ASC|DESC], 
   column2 [ASC|DESC],
   ...;
   ```
- By default, the ORDER BY clause uses ASC if you donâ€™t explicitly specify any option.
* To make the query more readable, you can assign the expression in the SELECT clause a column alias and use that column alias in the ORDER BY clause as shown in the following query:
```
SELECT 
    orderNumber,
    orderLineNumber,
    quantityOrdered * priceEach AS subtotal
FROM
    orderdetails
ORDER BY subtotal DESC;
```
- The column alias can be used in the ORDER BY clause because the SELECT clause is evaluated before the ORDER BY clause. By the time the ORDER BY clause is evaluated, the column alias is accessible.
- The ORDER BY  clause allows you to sort data using a custom list by using the __FIELD()  function.__
`Suppose that you want to sort the sales orders based on their statuses in the following order:`
```
In Process
On Hold
Canceled
Resolved
Disputed
Shipped
```
`To do this, you can use the FIELD() function to map each order status to a number and sort the result by the result of the FIELD() function:`

```
SELECT 
    orderNumber, 
    status
FROM
    orders
ORDER BY 
    FIELD(status,
        'In Process',
        'On Hold',
        'Cancelled',
        'Resolved',
        'Disputed',
        'Shipped');
```
